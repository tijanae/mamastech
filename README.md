An Uber for ordering basic technician services to you home; Mama's tech seeks to eliminate the frustration of waiting for assistance.

Every user begins this app by logging in. User profiles will save prior history of orders as well as personal data pertinent to their appointments.

In the case of no prior appointments users will use the service tab to select an intial service concern. Additional services requests can be made later.

Once completed users will be notified with information about the tech who will shortly arrive.
